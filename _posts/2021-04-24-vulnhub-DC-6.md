看提示

At Wordy, we know just how important it is to have secure plugins, and for this reason, we endeavour to provide the most secure and up-to-date plugins that are available on the market.

应该是插件的漏洞？

## CLUE

OK, this isn't really a clue as such, but more of some "we don't want to spend five years waiting for a certain process to finish" kind of advice for those who just want to get on with the job.

cat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep k01 > passwords.txt That should save you a few years. ;-)
